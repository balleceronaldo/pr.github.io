This is a document for ALLOWED and UNACCEPTABLE variable names for JavaScript

The following are rules for naming a variable:

1. Start them with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.

2. After the first letter, you can use numbers, as well as letters, underscores, or dollar signs.

3. Don’t use any of JavaScript’s reserved keywords.


Three examples of VALID or ALLOWED variable names in JavaScript:

redCard
house4Rent
YOU_CAN_EDIT


Three examples of INVALID or UNACCEPTABLE variable names:

always%
2good2betrue
function


Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVar, MyVar, and myvar are all different variables. But generally, it’s a good practice to avoid naming variables so similarly.
